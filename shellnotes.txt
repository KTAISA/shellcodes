Remote Shell notes -------------------------------

2 types of ways to get remote shell access

direct remote shell - behaves as a server. it works like a ssh or telnet server. user / attacker connects to a specfici port on the target machine and gets automatically access to a shell.

Reverse Remote shell - application running on target machine connects back a specific server and port on user/attacker machine

Reverse Shell benefits -------

firewalls usually block incoming connections, but the allow outgoing connections in order to provide internet
the user/attacker does not need to know the IP of the target machine running the shell. the user/attacker machine must be FIXED IP to let shell call home.
usually there are many outgoing messages on a machine and few or 0 servers running on it. this makes detection a little bit harder, even harder if shells connects on port 80
